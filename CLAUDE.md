# MRTKLIB (Modern RTKLIB) — Development Guide

## 1. Project Overview

**MRTKLIB** is a modernized, unified GNSS positioning library that integrates JAXA's MALIB, claslib, and madocalib into a single cohesive C/C++ package built on a modern CMake/vcpkg architecture.

### Current Phase: CLAS Engine Unification

The MADOCALIB PPP algorithm integration (PPP, PPP-AR, PPP-AR+iono) is **complete** with all L6E/L6D data flows working. The next phase is merging claslib into the unified parameter framework.

### Phase History

1. ~~Structural Migration~~ — MALIB-based code ported to `include/mrtklib/` + `src/` layout ✅
2. ~~PPP Engine Swap~~ — MADOCALIB PPP/PPP-AR/PPP-AR+iono algorithms integrated ✅
3. **CLAS Engine Unification** — Merging claslib into the unified parameter framework (current)

### Test Status (30/30 pass)

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Unit tests (12) | PASS | |
| SPP regression | PASS | |
| Receiver bias | PASS | |
| rtkrcv_rt | PASS | Real-time PPP via SBF file stream replay |
| MADOCA PPP | PASS | <0.5cm 3D RMS |
| MADOCA PPP-AR (mdc-004) | PASS | 1.562cm (tolerance 0.02m, LAPACK diff) |
| MADOCA PPP-AR (mdc-003) | PASS | |
| MADOCA PPP-AR+iono | PASS | 3.778cm (tolerance 0.04m, LAPACK diff) |

## 2. Your Role (AI Assistant)

1. **Algorithm Integration:** Port remaining claslib logic into the MRTKLIB structure while preserving mathematical correctness.
2. **Build & Compiler Support:** Resolve CMake, vcpkg, and C/C++ compiler issues (include paths, linkage, platform differences).
3. **Documentation:** Generate and maintain Doxygen-style docstrings for all functions, structs, and classes.
4. **Refactoring:** Modernize legacy C code to C++ idioms, but **only after** regression tests for the current state are passing.
5. **Regression Guarding:** Never let a change silently break existing positioning accuracy.

## 4. Coding Standards & Rules

- **No Mathematical Changes (unless explicitly instructed):** Do NOT alter GNSS algorithms, matrix operations, or physical constants during structural work.
- **Docstrings:** Strict Doxygen format:
  ```cpp
  /**
   * @brief Short description of the function.
   * @param[in]  param_name Description of input parameter.
   * @param[out] param_name Description of output parameter.
   * @return Return value description.
   */
  ```
- **C++ Modernization:** Prefer `std::vector` over raw arrays, smart pointers for resource management, rigorous `const` correctness. Maintain `extern "C"` compatibility for headers still included by legacy C files.
- **Formatting:** Assume `.clang-format` is in use. Keep code clean and readable.

## 5. Build Commands

| Action    | Command                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Configure | `cmake --preset default`                |
| Build     | `cmake --build build`                   |
| Test      | `cd build && ctest --output-on-failure` |

## 6. Key Technical Notes

### 6.1 rtcm_t Struct Size
`rtcm_t` is approximately **103 MB**. Never create static arrays of `rtcm_t`. Use heap allocation (`calloc`) and pointer arrays when multiple instances are needed.

### 6.2 LAPACK vs Embedded LU Solver
MRTKLIB uses system LAPACK; upstream madocalib uses an embedded LU solver. This causes ~1.5-3.8cm numerical differences in PPP-AR solutions. Test tolerances are adjusted accordingly.

### 6.3 pppiono_t Design
MRTKLIB uses a heap-allocated pointer (`nav->pppiono = calloc(...)`) while upstream uses an embedded struct (`nav.pppiono`). All access uses `->` instead of `.`.

### 6.4 Single L6E Stream Limitation
MRTKLIB currently supports only one L6E file. Multi-L6E requires changing `_mcssr` from singleton to array (`mcssr_t _mcssr[MCSSR_MAX_PRN]`) in `mrtk_madoca.c`, affecting ~56 references.

## 7. Workflow Orchestration

### 7.1 Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions).
- If something goes sideways, **STOP and re-plan immediately** — don't keep pushing.
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building.
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity.

### 7.2 Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean.
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents.
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents.
- One task per subagent for focused execution.

### 7.3 Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern.
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake.
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops.
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project.

### 7.4 Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works.
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant.
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.

### 7.5 Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution."
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer.
- Challenge your own work before presenting it.

### 7.6 Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding.
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them.
- Zero context switching required from the user.
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how.

## 8. Task Management

1. **Plan First:** Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items.
2. **Verify Plan:** Check in before starting implementation.
3. **Track Progress:** Mark items complete as you go.
4. **Explain Changes:** High-level summary at each step.
5. **Document Results:** Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`.
6. **Capture Lessons:** Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections.

## 9. Core Principles

- **Simplicity First:** Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness:** Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact:** Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
